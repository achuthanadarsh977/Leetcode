class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        prev , curr = None , head 

        while curr:

            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev

            prev = curr
            curr = temp
